# Brandon's Advent of Code Solutions
Here are my soltions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions for each year! I started in 2024, so that's all I have for now.

## Years

* 2024: 
    - First one I've ever done! We're in the middle of it right now so we'll see how I go. 
    - I'm currently in finals week in university, so it might be a couple weeks before I can get started.
    - Solutions will be programmed in C
